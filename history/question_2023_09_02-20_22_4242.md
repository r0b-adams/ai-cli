# What is an example of a closure?

An example of a closure in JavaScript or TypeScript is when a function is defined inside another function and has access to the outer function's variables, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Here's an example:

```typescript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = 'Hello';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closureExample = outerFunction();
closureExample(); // Output: Hello
```

In this example, `outerFunction` defines a variable `outerVariable` and a nested function `innerFunction`. `innerFunction` has access to `outerVariable` even after `outerFunction` has finished executing. When `outerFunction` is called and assigned to `closureExample`, it returns `innerFunction`. Finally, when `closureExample` is invoked, it logs the value of `outerVariable`, which is still accessible due to the closure.

Closures are powerful because they allow functions to retain access to variables from their parent scopes, even when those variables are no longer in scope. They are commonly used to create private variables and encapsulation in JavaScript and TypeScript.
